Lab notes Problem Set 7

Goal - using ensambel blastp and generate a code to align the protients of the two species.

Part 1
1. Ensembl is a database that stores all the diffrent genetic information about diffrent speciecs that you can use in diffrent projects 
    i)Head to Ensembl.org -> Downloads -> FTP site. From release 109, download:
2. write a script to extract the longest protien 
    i) make a one line fasta file - 
    ii) create empty strings to hold header and sequence lines as you move through them and strip the line make sure the file is sorted by gene name/ sort the file by genename
    iii) use a regular expression to extract out the gene id and set to the current header to look at as moving down the line 
        match= re.search('ENSDARG[0-9]+', curr_header)
        curr_gene_id=match.group()
    iv) use an if statment to set the current line being read as the longest protien until it reads a protien with higher length and sets the new protien as the "winner" or the longest protien
        if curr_gene_id != win_gene_id:
            out.write(f'{win_header}\n{win_seq}\n')
            win_gene_id=curr_gene_id
            win_seq=curr_seq
            win_header=curr_header
        
        elif len(curr_seq) > len(win_seq):
            win_gene_id=curr_gene_id
            win_header=curr_header
            win_seq=curr_seq
Part2 blastp

1.create a Blast database.
    i) create a new enviroment by logging into talapas on a node 
        -conda create -n blast
        -conda activate blast
        -conda install blast=2.14
    ii) This would have to be run on sbatch for the size of the database that you are using - look at the velvet manual in refence with the version of blast you are using 
        to run the sctipt use -- /usr/bin/time -v makeblastdb -in zebra_protingene.fa -dbtype prot -parse_seqids -out Zebrablast_p.db #for protien seq
        #we use the blast database to get faster searches, comprehensive comparisions, specific serches and easier updates , to make the database we need to use the file of the longest protien
2. Align the file from the longest protien of zebrafish and human and vise versa
    i) Since we have a generated database from the previous step we will now run the file of the longest human protien to the zebrafish database and viseversa
    ii) /usr/bin/time -v blastp \
        -num_threads=24 \ ---- number of cores being used on blast 
        -query $longest_protein \----variable name to be used to call a file 
        -db Zebrablast_p.db \ ---- your database file 
        -out Humanblastp.txt \ ----- out put file 
        -outfmt 6 \------- format of your output file to get the evalue and bitscore along with other information
        -evalue 1e-6 \ ----
        -use_sw_tback ---- will use the smith waterman during sequance aligment
